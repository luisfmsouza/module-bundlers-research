#Module bundlers research
This is a collection of interesting links about module bundlers, specially about [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io), [JSPM](http://jspm.io/) and comparison with both.

##Browserify
Browserify lets you ` require('modules') ` in the browser by bundling up all of your dependencies. [Getting Started](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#getting-started)

##Webpack
Getting started by reading the [documentation](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), which also contains an [introduction](http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html) and a [tutorial](http://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/).
